# Letterboxd Clone

This is a project cloning Letterboxd.com, a social networking site where users rate and review movies that they've seen. This is a personal project and not meant as any infringement on Letterboxd's copyright or original design.

It is built using React(specifically Create React App), GraphQL(Apollo Client and Yoga Server), and Prisma ORM.

Since this is in an early stage of development, it's missing the following features:

-   Users cannot follow other users on the site.
-   No search features exist.
-   There is no direct link for users to enter new movies. (They can do so by navigation to "\*/movies/new")
-   Users cannot add profile pictures or edit their profile.
-   The image sizing is all off.
-   Login doesn't redirect back to the last page you were looking at.
-   "Log Out" button is out of alignment on header.
